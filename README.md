# DHT-11-WITH-FIREBASE
This project creates a simple IoT system where temperature and humidity data from a DHT11 sensor are displayed on an I2C LCD and stored online in Firebase. This allows for real-time monitoring and data access from anywhere, demonstrating how to combine hardware and cloud services effectively in IoT applications.
# AIM
